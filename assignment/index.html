      <ol>
        <li>Last week I recieved feedback about writting else if rather than just else in one of my conditionals.<br>
           When working in Atom I often get an error code if I just use else, but the error goes away if I use else if.<br>
           Could you tell me why that is?<br>
           I do understand that if, else OR if, else if, else is best practice, but what if the code editor doesn't agree?<br>
           And if else if is not the correct way to format conditionals, please let me know what the correct formatting is. Thanks!<br>
